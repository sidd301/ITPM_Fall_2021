                <p style="text-decoration: underline"> What is Apex Legends?</p>
                <p>
                    Apex legends is a battle royale game with either a 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos.
                    These duos/trios land on an island and search for weapons/supplies before eliminating other players
                    on the island.
                </p>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline"> What Makes Apex Legends Unique to the Battle Royale Genre?</p>
                <p>
                    Unlike popular Battle Royales such as Fortnite or PUBG, Apex Legends utilizes a unique movement system that
                    resembles parkour. Therefore, the player is able to move around the buildings/terrain in a very unique way.

        <div id="apexChar">
            <h1>BloodHound</h1>
            <img src="images1/bloodhound.png" style="width: 40%;" />
            <div class="apexContent">
                <p>
                    BloodHound is one of the most iconic characters within Apex Legends. This character is known as a Technological Tracker because of
                    their ability to see the footsteps and markings of enemies near them. BloodHound utilizes a form of scanning technology to spot enemies
                    at a distance.

                    "I am the hunter the Gods have sent."
                </p>
            </div>

        <div id="apexChar">
            <h1>Gibraltar</h1>
            <img src="images1/gibby.png" style="width: 40%;" />
            <div class="apexContent">
                Gibraltar or popularily known as Gibby is one of the main defensive/tank characters within the Apex Legends universe. This character
                is known for his bubble which is a shield that he can throw near him. His ultimate is also one of the most lethal ultimates within the
                game as he will throw down a gernade looking object which signals an airstrike to rain down on his enemies.

                "Try to move me; it'll be fun."
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="apexChar">
            <h1>Bangalore</h1>
            <img src="images1/bangalore.png" style="width: 40%;" />
            <div class="apexContent">
                Bangalore is known as one of the best skirmishing and dueling characters within the game. She excels at disrupting enemies with her smoke-screen
                and her high mobility through the use of her passive which grants her bonus movement speed when in combat. She pairs quite well with Bloodhound through
                their smoke-screen and scan tactic. Her ultimate is similar to Gibraltar's, however it is a weaker version.

                "Name the weapon--I'll still beat you."
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="apexChar">
            <h1>Octane</h1>
            <img src="images1/octane.png" style="width: 40%;" />
            <div class="apexContent">
                Octane is widely recognized as one of the fastest characters in Apex Legends. His title is the High-Speed Daredevil and he
                lives up to his name. He uses a stim injection to move 30% faster for six seconds, while his ultimate is throwing a launchpad
                infront of him for his teammates to use. This character is incredibly mobile and can reposition himself in fights extremely
                quickly.

                "Whoa... what a rush!"
